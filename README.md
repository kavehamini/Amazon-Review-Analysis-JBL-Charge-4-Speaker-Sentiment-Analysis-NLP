# Amazon Review Analysis for JBL Charge 4 Speaker -Sentiment Analysis-NLP
 
 
 ## Introduction
 
In this project the reviews (ratings, review titles, review texts, color and number of comments) for the JBL Charge 4 Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker have been obtained by scraping Amazon.com website. Then the data has been cleaned up and transformed, analyzed and visualized. Also the cleaned up data has been saved as a sqlite file. Machine Learning models Naive Bayes Multinominal Classifier and K-Nearing Neighbors have been employed to analyze the sentiment of the reviewers and predict how they have rated the product and if their review has received any feedback (comments).


## The Data

The data used in this project have been scraped from https://www.amazon.com/ and stored as a dataframe in pandas. The cleaned data has been then stored as a sqlite file.


## Tools Used

splinter and chromedriver.exe have been used for scraping. Python and its modules such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc have been used for analysis of the data. Also sklearn module of python has been used to create Naive Bayes Multinominal classifier and KNN machine learning models.
